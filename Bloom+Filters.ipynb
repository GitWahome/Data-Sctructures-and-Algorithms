    "<p>Given a set of elements, a bloom filter can be used to infer the presence of any element in the set. It has some very weird answers though, if the element is not there, then it will tell you NO (Never will there be a FALSE NEGATIVE, phew!). If it is there (or not, Its all mystical), on the other hand, depending on some probabilities that I will discuss later, it will tell you MAYBE.(Just a fun fact, it is said that a Bloom Filter is like asking a girl on a date. NO means NO, that much is true, but a MAYBE can be either a YES or a NO. To be safe just keep your heart to yourself).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>More detail on the MAYBE, when a Bloom Filter returns maybe, the implication could be that the element actually exists('TRUE POSITIVE' ), or it doesnt, but due to some overlap in hash return values in the bit array/table from which inferences and lookups are made, a FALSE POSITIVE when SEARCHING may be returned.  The upside of this uncertainty is space efficiency.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>From the logic above, one can think of bloom filters as lighter manifestations of hash tables. In regards to operations, Bloom filters can perform efficient INSERTIONS and SEARCHES with one perk over hash tables hence why we refer to them as lightweight hash tables, they are SPACE EFFICIENT. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Given the properties above, one can infer the usefulness of Bloom filters. A key aspect to consider is the false positivity as it is what makes the data structure useless is some instances where utmost precision iss key regardless of space complexity. But in cases where we  <ol><li> Want to save on space and inevitably speed since we are cutting down on write operations and packet transfers.</p>\n",
    "    </li><li>2. We can do with the False Positives: Bloom filters can help. an example is IP blocking systems or even browser page screens. In the IP case, blocked IPs can sometimes access a system. This is unwanted but for the most part managable using r-w-x permissions, capcha checks and tokens. But unblocked ones, true customers should never be blocked whatsoever. We also dont want to waste people's time authenticating, loading packets on the web since connectivity is slow in most of the world plus saving a list of IPS can cost too much space.</li></ol><p> For this reason, we can justify the occasional access by blocked IPs by the speed of access on our site and are sure we will well serve our clients. In regards to website screening, I would rather be warned that a site is not safe but it actually(Maybe because it does not have an ssl or uses http instead of https) instead of not being warned but the site be virus infected. Google's dynamic repo of unsafe sites is extensive but a number of them are in fact safe. Bloom filters here are useful in that when one seeks to access one of the safe sites, they can never be told it is unsafe as its id eg IP always hashes into the same values.  A safe site on the other hand when looked up may return a warning as Its ID may hash into values marked unsafe by other sites. This is okay since we are given the proceed option most of the time or just undergo a security check, maybe a captcha or something. Better safe than sorry. Bloom filters are very paramount in internet security for this reason.</p>\n",

Being algorithmicly generated, the original value can be generated by reverse engineering the hashing algorithm but the beauty of it is that a unique value will be generated for every of our inputs. This will be the case for all functions I use here. It supports incremental hashing thus very convenient for batch processing of large amounts of data that have some structure with them. In my IP example, this is beneficial. This is a primitive example but the idea is pretty apparent. If I had a sequence of say IDs for my clients in lieu of IPs, then I can fast compute their hash values based on the previous values and this can significantly increase processing speed thus allow for faster service delivery.</p></li>\n",

In my case, the basis will be a 32 bit value and it will be determined by the FNV prime as this is a pure FNV Implementation. The hash works as follows, each of the 32 bit values in the FNV offset basis, they are multiplied by the FNV prime then 'XORed' with the byte from the input. The FNV prime is a prime number that is determined by: Given an integer t that is less than 11 but greater than 4, n which is 2 exponent s is computed. t which is 5+ n all divided by 12 is also computer and the result is always truncated down.
