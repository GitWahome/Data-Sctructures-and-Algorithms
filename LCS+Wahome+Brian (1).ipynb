To identify the parent, I will make this assumption as a superposition: The children are the ones who have lost similarity to their elders with time meaning that the most similar genes are the oldest then any that comes after is a child, then grandchild. This is based on the assumption that this is a family unit which might not be the case but will serve well in illustrating the variations. You can imagine the insertions and deletions being from marrying someone not from the family thus causing a variation. Over time the genes that the children posses will vary considerably from the original parents. In case two subsequent strings have the same length of LCS, I assume they are siblings. </p>\n",
    "<p>I will make inferences as to who the next children belong to depending on the other pairings.&#10; I will ignore any genes I select already even if the connection is very strong. The assumption here would be that the child inherited a lot of the ancestors genes as the genes were dominant. If the connection is greater of equal to 75, I assume these must be children of some parent. I start with Gene pair 1 and 2 with Gene 1 as the first parent then build from there:  With a connection of 70+ between genes and a common parent I assume these can be siblings.</p>\n",

    "<p><b>DISCUSSION:</b>\n",
    "<p>My motive was to develop a family tree between the gene sequences while retaining the strongest connections possible. As seen above, With Gene 1 as the first parent and Gene 2 the first child based on their connection strength, The sequence developed was such that Gene 3 and Gene 0 were added as sibling with a common parent Gene 1 because the connections were all very strong. The interconnection between the siblings varied with Gene 2 and 3 at  73,Gene 2 and 0 at 73 and Gene 0 and 3 at 72 which does seem plausible that the children generally have similar levels of similarities between each other and even higher similarity levels between them and the Parent. The reduced similarity is probably due to inheriting different genes from the other parent, Patner to Gene 1. I bet Gene 1 was the mother since children inherit most chromosomes from the mother, then The insertions that caused the variability were from the father. \n",
    "<p>Gene 0 had a child, Gene 6 based on their 80 connection. Gene 6 had no siblings. Gene 6  bore 2 children, Geme 4 and Gene 5 and their connection to her stands at 82 and 79 respectively. Yes the connection was weaker in Gene 5. We can make the assumption that these inheritted more genes from the other spouse, perhaps they were boys? The connection between the two siblings under gene 6 was 71 which again seems similar to the ones above. They do vary but not to such a great extent having common parents.</p>\n",

    "<p><b>INSERTIONS:</b>&nbsp; <p>My logic here was, given a pair and having derived their LCS, then the difference between the first one and the LCS must be what was changed(All mutations combined). The difference between the second one and the LCS would be the new additions/ deletions, basically the top up genes that give the second one Its itentity. I subtracted the length of the differences between the second and LCS and the first and LCS. If the second was greater such that the difference was positive, that I regarded as an Insertion and counted the number of Insertions made based on this. The <b>PROBABILITY</b> is the proportion of Genes inserted to the Original gene, the first pair. This I recorded in my data set as per the call results below. Run to see:</p>\n",

This I recorded in my data set as per the call results below. Run to see:</p>\n",

I know what potion is attributed to insertions and deletions hence whence I calculate this difference, I take away the proportion due to these two mods and attribute any remainder modifications to the mutation modifier. <b>PROBABILITY</b> is the proportion of Genes Mutated to the Original gene, the first pair.

    "<p><b>Total variability and weaknesses:</b>&nbsp; <p>The probability of any of these or all to happen is a summation of the individual probabilities. From here, one can see a number of weaknesses in our estimates. Insertions and deletions are not mutually exclusive. A special case for instance is if a gene is deleted then a similar one inserted. How will this be handled? The sum effect here is 0 and the LCS check will identify this new gene as part of the old one. This is a case we cannot solve as we will not count the insertions and deletions that happen yet they actually di. Also if the insertion or deletion did not affect the original order of the sequence, we will not be able to know if they happened. Similarly, if a mutation does not affect the original order, we will also not know if it happened. <b>ASSUMPTION:</b> To handle such special cases, we assume that the modifications only count if they brough forth variation. This way, even if a snippet of 100 genes was taken away and a similar gene from a different source inserted, the total modification is basically Null. <b><em>Insertions, deletions and mutations only count if they cause variation.</em></b></p>\n",

    "<p><b>Weaknesses:</b></p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>If the samples are from the same person and all connections are basically of the same magnitude ie have the same LCS, then how does it gauge the parent-child connection? This I imagine can be solved by on the Mutations probabilities where the further the immediate connection even if there a lot of similarities, the more likely it is a child. The algorithm might have some collisions if the deletions and insertions are not clear enough.The key is to identify the sequence that showes increasing modification as the family gets younger.</li>\n",
    "<li>Unrelated sequences: If sequences have absolutely no similarity, then as per my algorithm, this could be a problem since. We can solve this by setting threshold connection levels to allow a child to be a child to a parent.</li>\n",
    "<li>Cousins: The genes between siblings are very similar. Their children could inherit similar gene sequences and thus, we might end up attributing cousins as children of the same parent.</li>\n",
    "<li>Disconnect between children: If children have the same parents and happen to have little similarity to each other, this could be a problem as it would not make sense why children of the same generation have experienced such a varying level of mutation given that the probabilities being from the same parent are generally similar. This is probability though hence we can speculate, maybe the parent cheated, who knows. Genes are complicated.</li>\n",
    "<li>Very similar children: My criteria for identifying parents and children was identifying the stringest connection. If children happen to have huge similarities, a contrast to the situation above, my algorithm would struggle to rank them as either childre of a parent or siblings. I made the assumption that if the connection is too strong they must be parent-children but this was for this example. The criteria is hard to handle since in real life for instance, twins have very strong similarities, perhaps stronger than both of them even have with the parents. This is a tough jar to open but given more mutations data Im sure can be used to refine the algorithm for more accurate results, as with most cases above.</li>\n",

This is the most computationally intensive section of my code and will always be conducted in all situations. Even in the average or best case, this matrix must be generated to track down the LCS. The worst case would be where our System does not have an LCS but we go ahead and look anyway. Best case if where two strings are similar and all the computattions were 'worth it'. One might be tempted  handle these cases by having a similarity check prior to matrix generation but this check should also Have the same O(N) time complexity. We can <b>IMPROVE</b> our performance by trimming the strings i.e checking for similar first elements at the start and end, recording these as part of the LCS anyway and it should be in O(N) in worst case as stated above where our strings are similar which is better than O(N^2) with our matrix and we save the space. Even if this is not the case, we reduce the size of or look up thus achieve faster computational times.</p></li>\n",

Big-Θ(N(t)M(t)) is less than or equal to Big-O(NM). N(t)M(t) are the trimmed versions of the strings and the generated matri will correspond to their size. The best case is where the similarity check determines the strings are similar and returns one of them as the LCS hence we never have to generate the matrix saving us (NM) cell spaces as well as skipping a lot of computation. This improvement has been implemented in my code but not the trimming. The probabilities for modification in this case will be 0..</p></li>\n",
